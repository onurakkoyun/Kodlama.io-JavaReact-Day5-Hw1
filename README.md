<p>Below, I have written the requirements and acceptance criteria for registration and entry into the system in an e-commerce system. We want to write a Java backend for this system.<br>
<br>
<b>Users should be able to become a member by entering their information into the system.</b><br>

● It should be possible to become a member of the system with basic user information, e-mail and password. Basic user information: first name, last name, email, password. All the basics are mandatory.<br>
● Password must be at least 6 characters.<br>
● The e-mail field must be in e-mail format. (Do it with regex. Research subject)<br>
● E-Mail must not have been used before.<br>
● First and last name must be at least two characters.<br>
● A confirmation e-mail should be sent to the user as a result of membership. (Simulation)<br>
● Membership must be completed when the verification link is clicked. (Simulation)<br>
● In case of failure or success, the user should be informed.<br>
<br>
<b>Users must be able to sign up to the system with their Google account. (Simulation)</b><br>
<br>
● Other authorization services may be used in the future. (Configure the system as external service integration.)<br>
● In case of failure or success, the user should be informed.<br>
<br>
<b>Users should be able to login to the system with their e-mail and password information.</b><br>
<br>
● Email and password are required<br>
● In case of failure or success, the user should be informed.<br><br>
  <b>Limitation: Do not use any additional packages. Proceed entirely from what we saw.</b></p>
